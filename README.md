# Delta-Based-Trajectory-Gap-Filling-for-Aircraft-Flights-use-Seq2Seq-LSTM
This project focuses on trajectory gap completion for aircraft flights using a delta-based Seq2Seq LSTM model trained on real ADS-B flight data.  The goal is to reconstruct missing trajectory segments (gaps) by learning physical motion patterns instead of directly predicting absolute positions.
